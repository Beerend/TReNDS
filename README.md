# TReNDS
Project for 'Capita Selecta in Computer Vision and Biometrics'.

### Work from others used during this project:
1. models.resnet is copied from <a href='https://github.com/SeuTao/RSNA2019_Intracranial-Hemorrhage-Detection/blob/master/3DNet/models/resnet.py'> SeuTao</a>.
2. models.deeplight is reconstructed from the description of the DeepLight framework presented by <a href='https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01321/'>Thomas <i>et al.</i> (2019) as 'Analyzing Neuroimaging Data Through Recurrent Deep Learning Models' in <i>Frontiers in Neuroscience</i></a>.
3. models.resnet_4d is based on the design of ResNet by <a href='https://github.com/SeuTao/RSNA2019_Intracranial-Hemorrhage-Detection/tree/bbdb1e1d645953ef4b2f23c87b6fba44aff023ea/3DNet'> SeuTao</a>, and uses 4D convolutional layers from <a href='https://github.com/timothygebhard/pytorch-conv4d'>Timothy Gebhard</a> and <a href='https://github.com/pvjosue/pytorch_convNd'>Josué Page Vizcaîno</a>.
4. train_TReNDS.ipynb and datasets.TReNDS is based on the project by <a href='https://github.com/SeuTao/RSNA2019_Intracranial-Hemorrhage-Detection/tree/bbdb1e1d645953ef4b2f23c87b6fba44aff023ea/3DNet'> SeuTao</a>.

Many thanks to the ones above!
